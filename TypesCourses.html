            <h2>Types of Courses and Walls</h2>
            <p>There are three main types of walls: Vertical faces, slabs, and overhangs. Vertical faces and just vertical walls with not degree.
                Slabs are walls at a slightly obtuse angle which means climbing them requires more balance and technique. The type of shoes here makes a big difference.
                since hand and foot placements need to be very precise, though slabs require a lot less strength. Overhangs are walls which are hung at an acute angle.
                Climbing these walls means you'll be close to upside down for a large part of the climb, meaning they require way more core and arm strength than the other type of walls.
                Routes on these are generally harder and way more exhausting. 

                Many routes also have their own theme. They often contain the same types of holds throughout so some climbs are more strengthy,
                or crimpy, etc.
