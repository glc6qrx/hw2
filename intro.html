            <h4>Getting Started: Equipment</h4>
            <p>When you climb for the first time at a climbing gym, you'll need two things: shoes and chalk, both of which 
                are offered for rentals at climbing gyms. Climbing shoes are vastly different from normal running shoes. In general, 
            they are tighter especially around the toes. Most climbers wear 1-2 sizes down from their regular shoe size. Tighter shoes 
        are necessary because they all you to use your feet in the most precise way as possible while climbing. But for new climbers, 
        this isn't as important and you can get whatever size feels comfortable. Chalk is also important. Chalk provides friction
    between your hands and the holds, allowing you to have much better grip. There are different types of chalk as well, but again
     the rental chalk is fine to use.</p>
     <h4>Getting Started: First Climb</h4>
            <p>Climbing routes are generally separated by color meaning climbing that route means you can only touch the holds with the same color.
                 Each route will have a different tag, usually denoting the difficulty of the route. There are two common grading systems. One is V# 
                system, where the higher the number the harder it is. The other is the color grading system where routes are given a color to
            show their difficulty. These vary based on the climbing gym. In general new climbers should work on v0-v1s depending on their athleticism.</p>
